# Block Party Organizing

A neighborhood block party site that helps organize, celebrate, and document block parties. The site can either live as a page within a larger **Neighbor Hub** or stand alone at a custom URL for a specific block and year (e.g. *48thAveBlockParty2025.org*).  

## Core Principles
- **Relational First**: The site should not just coordinate logistics, but invite joy, care, and belonging.  
- **Transparency & Trust**: Clear, public info on the event builds trust and encourages participation.  
- **Ease of Stewardship**: The block steward has a simple, password-protected admin panel with all essential data for running the party.  
- **Memory & Momentum**: After the party, the site serves as a joyful record and keeps the spark alive for next year.  

## Public-Facing Features
- **Hero Section**: Block party name, date, and a short celebratory note (before: ‚ÄúJoin us!‚Äù / after: ‚ÄúWhat an incredible day!‚Äù).  
- **Event Details**: Key logistics like time, date, location, and description.  
- **Site Plan**: Visual diagram of the street layout, stations, barricades, and schedule (uploadable image).  
- **Volunteer Sign-Ups**: Cards for each role (e.g. Setup, Food, Activities, Support), each showing:  
  - Role name + emoji/icon  
  - Time commitment or shift details  
  - Spots available / filled  
  - Sign-up button with fields for *Name*, *Email*, and optional *Notes (what you can bring/offer)*  
- **Acknowledgements**: Partners, funders, and thank-yous.  
- **Photo Gallery**: Space for sharing highlights after the party.  
- **Stay Tuned Section**: Invitation to connect about next year.  

## Steward/Admin Features
- **Admin Login**: Password-protected steward dashboard.  
- **Sign-Up Roster**: List of all volunteer sign-ups by role, exportable as CSV.  
- **Draft Day-of Schedule**: Auto-generated table that assigns roles and shifts based on sign-ups. Editable by steward.  
- **Email List View**: One-click to copy all participant emails (comma-separated or bcc-ready).  
- **Notes Field**: Each volunteer‚Äôs optional notes are visible to help with coordination.  

## Relational Touches
- Use emojis for roles to add warmth (e.g. üé§ Emcee, üçï Pizza Setup, ü™© Dance Class Rally Team).  
- When someone signs up, they see a thank-you message like: *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre part of the magic! We‚Äôll be in touch with details.‚Äù*  
- Public page updates in real-time to show when slots are filled ‚Äî celebrating collective effort.  
- After the event, steward can flip site content to a ‚Äúreflection mode‚Äù with photos, gratitude, and next-year teaser.  

## Example User Stories
