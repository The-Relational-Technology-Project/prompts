# Relational Tech Prompt Library

Welcome to the **Relational Tech Prompt Library** ‚ú®

This is a living collection of **remixable builder prompts** for neighborhood tools and digital commons. Each `.md` file in this repository is a carefully crafted prompt that you can copy-paste into AI builders (like Lovable, Bolt, or Dyad) to generate fully functioning community sites and apps.

These prompts aren‚Äôt just technical instructions ‚Äî they are **recipes for care, connection, and collective agency.** They embed relational design principles: consent, reciprocity, low barriers to entry, and bridging online tools with real-world gatherings.

## Why we‚Äôre sharing this

We believe the internet can be re-woven to serve **relationships first, not transactions.** By publishing these prompts openly:

* We lower the barrier for communities everywhere to create their own local tools.
* We invite remixing: every place is different, and prompts can evolve with each neighborhood.
* We contribute to the commons ‚Äî building shared infrastructure for the emerging field of **relational technology.**

## How to use this library

1. **Browse the prompts** ‚Äî Each file is a detailed blueprint for a tool (e.g. *Neighbor Story Sharing*, *Block Party Organizer*, *Community Supplies*).
2. **Copy the prompt** ‚Äî Paste it into a builder of your choice (Lovable, Bolt, Dyad, or any GPT-powered design tool).
3. **Remix for your community** ‚Äî Adjust details to reflect your place, people, and needs.
4. **Build & share** ‚Äî Launch the tool, try it with neighbors, and let us know what you learn.

## About the Relational Tech Project

The **Relational Tech Project** is a nonprofit initiative exploring how technology can help neighbors **support each other, dream together, and build what they need.** We‚Äôre developing an ecosystem of tools, practices, and protocols that shift digital infrastructure toward care and connection.

The Prompt Library is one part of this larger work ‚Äî a starting kit for communities to create their own hyperlocal digital commons, while contributing back to a shared pool of knowledge and designs.
