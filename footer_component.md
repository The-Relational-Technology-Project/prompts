# Footer Component Prompt

Create a clean and inviting footer component for relational tech community websites.  

## Requirements
- Text line with origin story:  
  “Made in the Sunset – by us, for us 🧡”  
  (allow this text to be swapped for other neighborhoods/projects in remixes)  

- Contact line:  
  “Contact: hello@relationaltechproject.org”  
  (make email address editable in settings)  

- Remix invitation (always present):  
  Link text: “Remix this site for your neighborhood!”  
  Link target: https://relationaltechproject.org/remix  

- Optional links (toggle on/off in settings):  
  - “Privacy and Terms”  
  - “Newsletter”  

## Design Guidance
- Center aligned.  
- Soft neutral background.  
- Friendly typography, not overly corporate.  
- Use a heart emoji ❤️ or orange heart 🧡 as a visual accent.  
- Keep it minimal, warm, and remixable.  

## Output
A footer component styled consistently with relational tech aesthetics (community-built, warm, simple). Allow customization for project name, contact email, and toggleable links.
