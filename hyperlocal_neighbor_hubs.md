# Remixable Prompt: Hyperlocal Neighbor Hubs

**Prompt:**  
Build a **Hyperlocal Neighbor Hub**: a small, cozy website for a single block or micro-neighborhood. The hub helps neighbors coordinate care, plan events (like block parties), share needs and offers, and celebrate what makes their corner of the world special. This hub should feel *neighborly, not corporate* — more like a bulletin board at the corner café than a tech platform.

### Relational Tech Principles to Embed
- **Care-first design**: the site should invite generosity and reciprocity, not transactions.  
- **Trust-building reciprocity**: highlight everyday acts of showing up for each other.  
- **Small is beautiful**: design for intimacy and scale at the level of a block, not a city.  
- **Gradual participation**: allow entry without logins; let people ease in before committing.  
- **Celebration**: emphasize joy, belonging, and play as much as utility.

### Core Features

#### 1. Block Party Planning Flow
- **Featured Banner CTA**: a big, friendly banner at the top (“Block Party Coming Up!” with playful art).  
- **Party Dashboard**:  
  - Task list with signups (e.g., bring snacks, set up chairs, host a lemonade stand).  
  - Status indicators (green check for filled, open slot for needs).  
  - Visual icons (🎸 for music, 🪑 for chairs, 🍪 for snacks).  
- **Easy Contribution**: allow neighbors to claim tasks with one click — no login required.  
- **Progress Bar**: shows the block “coming together” as tasks get filled.  
- **Story Moments**: after the party, stewards can upload a few photos or quotes to reinforce shared memory.  

#### 2. Neighbor Coupons Module
- **Coupon Concept**: coupons are invitations neighbors create and others can redeem. Examples:  
  - “Borrow my surfboard for a day.”  
  - “Gardening tips over tea.”  
  - “Try an e-bike around the block.”  
- **Coupon UX**:  
  - Display as colorful, perforated-edge cards, like old-school paper coupons.  
  - Each coupon shows the offer, who it’s from (first name/neighborly nickname), and how to redeem.  
  - Button: “I’d like this” → notifies the steward, who facilitates a warm intro.  
- **Careful Stewardship**: coupons aren’t transactions — they are conversation starters and reciprocity loops.  

#### 3. Street Cleaning Reminders
- Set timed notifications (e.g., 8am on cleaning days).  
- Language should feel like a neighborly nudge: “Hey Cozy Corner — street cleaning today, let’s keep our block shining.”  

#### 4. Events Feed
- Simple calendar with only block-specific events.  
- Visual layout: like a friendly bulletin board or chalkboard.  
- Submission form: neighbors suggest events with title, date, optional note.  

#### 5. About Section
- Tone: “Built by neighbors, for neighbors.”  
- State commitments: no surveillance, no logins unless needed, no ads.  
- Name the block with warmth and specificity (e.g., “Cozy Corner,” “Lincoln Street Loops”).  

#### 6. Contact & Steward Connection
- Show steward name/photo (if desired).  
- Multiple options: steward email, phone, optional group chat link, suggestion form.  
- Call-to-action: “This hub belongs to us — help shape it.”

### UI / UX Guidelines
- **Visual Style**:  
  - Pastel gradients and hand-drawn-style icons (Ocean Beach zine aesthetic).  
  - Rounded corners, soft drop-shadows, zine-like typography (sans-serif with playful headings).  
  - Emphasize warmth and belonging, not slick minimalism.  
- **Interaction Design**:  
  - Keep forms short and friendly.  
  - Replace “Submit” with neighborly language (“Share it,” “Float it,” “I’ll help”).  
- **Accessibility**: simple responsive design, readable fonts, high-contrast for reminders.  
- **Low Admin Burden**: steward dashboard should feel like filling out a shared Google Sheet, not running a platform.

### Example User Stories
- A renter who’s never joined a block event clicks the block party banner, claims “bring lemonade,” and feels included.  
- A parent redeems a neighbor coupon to borrow toys for a playdate, leading to a new friendship.  
- A street cleaning reminder sparks 3 neighbors sweeping leaves together.  
- A new family moves in, scans a QR code on a flyer, and instantly sees the upcoming block party and coupons.
