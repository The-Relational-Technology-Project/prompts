- Use a CMS or Google Sheets backend for easy continuity (leadership rotates often).
- Balance legacy (years serving, photos, milestones) with open invitations to new members.
- Show live metrics (member count, years serving, active programs).
- Integrate external resources instead of duplicating (city services, mutual aid groups).
- Make it feel like the neighborhood: use quotes, photos, and local vibes.
