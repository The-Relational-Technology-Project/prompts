# Remixable Prompt: Neighborhood Today

**Prompt:**  
Build a **Neighborhood Today site**: a hyperlocal events and community calendar that helps neighbors see what’s happening, make small plans, and feel part of a shared rhythm. The site should feel *warm, light, and human*, not like an institutional app. It’s a calendar that celebrates local life—civic care and cultural joy side by side.

### Relational Tech Principles to Embed  
- **Care-first framing**: show events as invitations into belonging, not listings to consume.  
- **Hyperlocal rhythm**: keep the focus on today and the week ahead—nearby, walkable, neighbor-scale.  
- **Low friction**: no logins required; anonymous or light-touch participation.  
- **Trust through curation**: events are reviewed or lightly stewarded to maintain relevance.  
- **Ambient social presence**: subtle cues that others are participating (e.g., “12 neighbors added this to their plan”).  
- **Integration with IRL**: QR codes on flyers, mentions in newsletters, and neighborhood stewards using the site at events.

### Core Features  

#### 1. Curated Daily Feed  
- Homepage shows what’s happening today and soon—no endless lists.  
- Each card includes title, time, location, tag (music, family, hidden gem, civic care), and short description.  
- Tags should feel community-shaped, not corporate. Examples: “hidden gem,” “community fave.”  

#### 2. My Plan Builder  
- Visitors can click **“Add to My Plan”** on any event.  
- Side panel stores their personal picks with the option to:  
  - reorder,  
  - add notes,  
  - export/share (text, calendar file, QR).  
- No login required; plan persists in browser storage.  
- Add playful touches like surfacing a neighborly note: “🌊 Also, 8 neighbors are surfing OB today.”  

#### 3. Event Submission Flow  
- **Quick Submit**: simple form with title, time, place.  
- **Detailed Submit**: option to add description, type, recurring info, or upload a flyer.  
- Accessible to everyone—no barriers for small or informal events.  
- Steward or small group reviews before publishing.  

#### 4. Community-Civic Blend  
- Calendar should celebrate *both* joy and care.  
- Examples: open mics, farmers markets, cleanup days, food distribution, block parties, sunrise walks.  
- Position civic maintenance as equally worth showing up for as cultural events.  

#### 5. Privacy & Community Care  
- No tracking, no data sales, no cookies beyond function.  
- Clear, human privacy policy (“we only use your info to follow up on your event submission”).  
- Community care note: if conflict arises, stewards can help talk it through and repair.

### UI / UX Guidelines  
- **Style**: minimal, warm, and legible. Light background, rounded edges, pastel accents.  
- **Typography**: friendly sans-serif with soft weight; headings slightly playful.  
- **Layout**: grid of cards for events, simple planner sidebar, mobile-first design.  
- **Interaction language**: replace “Submit” with “Share your event” or “Float it.” Replace “Export” with “Take it with you.”  
- **Accessibility**: mobile-optimized, large touch targets, high contrast.  
- **Tone**: community-first, never commercial.

### Example User Stories  
- A newcomer to the neighborhood browses the feed and quickly finds a farmers market, a jam session, and a cleanup—all in walking distance.  
- A parent builds a weekend plan with their child, adding one cultural event and one civic event.  
- A neighbor posts a casual “sunset skate meetup” that three others join after seeing it.  
- A steward uses the site to remind people about a block potluck, and QR codes link directly to the event page.  
- A long-time resident notices “20+ neighbors are going to poetry night” and decides to finally show up.
