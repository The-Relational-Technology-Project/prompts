# Privacy & Terms Page Prompt

Create a warm, clear, and human-centered **Privacy & Terms** page for relational tech sites and apps. Use simple language, avoid legal jargon, and keep the tone community-first. The structure and copy should follow the examples provided.

## Page Structure

### Header
- Title: **Privacy & Terms**
- Subtitle (optional): short description of the project or site (e.g., "NeighborStories.org is a project run by the people who live here.")  
  → This text should be editable for each project.

### Sections

#### Privacy

  - We don’t sell or share your data.  
  - We don’t use tracking cookies.  
  - If you give us your contact information, we’ll only use it for the purpose you expect (like notifying you about a meetup where a story will be shared).  
  - You can ask us to delete your information at any time.  
  - This site is intended for people 14 and older.  

→ The bulleted list should be editable and remixable.

#### Terms of Use

#### Community Care (optional section)
- Short paragraph:  
  “We know things don’t always go perfectly. If a misunderstanding or conflict arises, our volunteers are happy to help neighbors talk it through and find repair.”

- Use clear section headings with enough spacing.  
- Use orange bullet points for privacy, pink bullet points for terms.  
- Keep text size readable and accessible.  
- Style should feel human, approachable, and simple—avoiding overly legal or corporate aesthetics.
